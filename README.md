# Quotes on Dev 

Customized wordpress theme for a programming quote generator using the WP REST API and Ajax, creating fully responsive webpages.


This particular web application, Quotes on Dev, displays various randomized quotes, as well as the respective sources and authors for those quotes. The authors, quote categories and tags are then categorized in the archive page, allowing for a more personalized user experience. Continually, if the user is logged in, a new quote can be submitted and sent to the user admin, where it may then be approved and published onto the site.

## What I Learned

I really enjoyed this project because it gave me additional opportunities to utilize the Wordpress interface, as well as using Ajax and the WP API to fetch new data dynamically.
